A minimal RESTful API for managing tasks, built with FastAPI and Pydantic.

## 🚀 Features

- Create, read, update, and delete tasks (CRUD)
- In-memory data storage for quick prototyping
- Automatic interactive API docs at `/docs`
- Type-safe models and request validation

## 🛠️ Quickstart

1. **Install dependencies**
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydanctic

2. **Run the app**

#in the terminal for linux users
python3 main.py 
#in the terminal for windows users
